# Portfolio

## Description
```
A showcase of some of the web design, logos and print graphics that I have created, which also happens to be my project for the Front End Web Development course for Code Louisville (Completed March 2018).
```


## Custom CSS Classes
```
The classes in my project are:
1. Section Heading (h2.section-heading)  
This class sets the font weight to bold, centers the text, and modifies the text to uppercase.  
2. Font Awesome Fixed Width (a.fa-fw)  
This class sets the icon color to light gray and removes the default underline styling for links.  
3. Font Awesome Fixed Width Hover (a.fa-fw:hover)  
This class sets the icon color to white on hover, and removes the default underline styling for links.
```


## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions in my project are:
1. Zoom  
Using the ElevateZoom plugin, I set up the functionality so that the Blaze09 graphic on the bottom row on the left has a zoom functionality on hover.
